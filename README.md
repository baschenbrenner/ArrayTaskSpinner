# ArrayTaskSpinner

This repo is a little app that allows the user to spin the wheel and get assigned a random task for any array that they find in arrays.js.

TODO:
1) make up arrays for arrays.js
2) finish describing tasks next to images on index.html
3) test - is it clear enough of a task that the student knows they have completed it? Where does the work happen? How can it be easily erased?
4) other ideas?
